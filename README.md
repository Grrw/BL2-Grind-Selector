# BL2-Grind-Selector
Different python scripts for deciding which Borderlands 2 boss to farm.

-- gFunc holds all functions  
-- Raids.py is for Raid Bosses only  
-- Seraphs.py is for Seraph Guardians only  
-- Legendaries is for Legendary dropping enemies, and has options for either picking from the two Legendary weapon raid bosses AND the others, OR ONLY non-raid bosses  
-- Bosses.py is for all re-killable enemies. This includes all raid, seraph, or legendary dropping enemies (even tubbies/chubbies)
